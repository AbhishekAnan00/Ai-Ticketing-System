# AI Ticketing System

The **AI Ticketing System** is a full‚Äëstack application that allows users to create support tickets which are enriched by an AI service. It features real‚Äëtime updates, file upload integration via the Gemini API, and JWT‚Äëbased authentication for secure access. The application is built with an Express/MongoDB backend and a modern Next.js frontend styled with Tailwind CSS.
